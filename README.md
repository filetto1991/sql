With the dataset you can find here: "https://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste/flw-data/en/", I used MySQL to make an analysis about the food wastage all around the world.
Inside the zip file, you can find two .sql files which are one, the query to make the table, and the second one, all the queries to do all my analysis
